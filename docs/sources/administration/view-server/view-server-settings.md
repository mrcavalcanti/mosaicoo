# View Mosaicoo server settings

> Refer to [Role-based access control]({{< relref "../../enterprise/access-control/_index.md" >}}) in Mosaicoo Enterprise to understand how you can control access with RBAC permissions.

If you are a Mosaicoo server administrator, use the Settings tab to view the settings that are applied to your Mosaicoo server via the [Configuration]({{< relref "../configuration.md#config-file-locations" >}}) file and any environmental variables.

> **Note:** Only Mosaicoo server administrators can access the **Server Admin** menu. For more information about about administrative permissions, refer to [About users and permissions]({{< relref "../manage-users-and-permissions/about-users-and-permissions.md" >}}).

## View server settings

1. Log in to your Mosaicoo server with an account that has the Mosaicoo Admin flag set.
1. Hover your cursor over the **Server Admin** (shield) icon in the side menu and then click the **Settings** tab.

## Available settings

For a full list of server settings, refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../configuration.md" >}}).
