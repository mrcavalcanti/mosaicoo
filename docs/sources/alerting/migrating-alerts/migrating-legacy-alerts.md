# Migrating legacy dashboard alerts

When Mosaicoo alerting is enabled or Mosaicoo is upgraded to the latest version, existing legacy dashboard alerts migrate in a format compatible with the Mosaicoo alerting. In the Alerting page of your Mosaicoo instance, you can view the migrated alerts alongside any new alerts. This topic explains how legacy dashboard alerts are migrated and some limitations.

> **Note:** This topic is only relevant for OSS and Enterprise customers. Contact customer support to enable or disable Mosaicoo alerting for your Cloud stack.

Read and write access to legacy dashboard alerts and Mosaicoo alerts are governed by the permissions of the folders storing them. During migration, legacy dashboard alert permissions are matched to the new rules permissions as follows:

- If alert's dashboard has permissions, it will create a folder named like `Migrated {"dashboardUid": "UID", "panelId": 1, "alertId": 1}` to match permissions of the dashboard (including the inherited permissions from the folder).
- If there are no dashboard permissions and the dashboard is under a folder, then the rule is linked to this folder and inherits its permissions.
- If there are no dashboard permissions and the dashboard is under the General folder, then the rule is linked to the `General Alerting` folder, and the rule inherits the default permissions.

> **Note:** Since there is no `Keep Last State` option for [`No Data`]({{< relref "../alerting-rules/create-grafana-managed-rule/#no-data--error-handling" >}}) in Mosaicoo alerting, this option becomes `NoData` during the legacy rules migration. Option "Keep Last State" for [`Error handling`]({{< relref "../alerting-rules/create-grafana-managed-rule/#no-data--error-handling" >}}) is migrated to a new option `Error`. To match the behavior of the `Keep Last State`, in both cases, during the migration Mosaicoo automatically creates a [silence]({{< relref "../silences/_index.md" >}}) for each alert rule with a duration of 1 year.

Notification channels are migrated to an Alertmanager configuration with the appropriate routes and receivers. Default notification channels are added as contact points to the default route. Notification channels not associated with any Dashboard alert go to the `autogen-unlinked-channel-recv` route.

Since `Hipchat` and `Sensu` notification channels are no longer supported, legacy alerts associated with these channels are not automatically migrated to Mosaicoo alerting. Assign the legacy alerts to a supported notification channel so that you continue to receive notifications for those alerts.
Silences (expiring after one year) are created for all paused dashboard alerts.
